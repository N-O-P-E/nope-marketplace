# Studio N.O.P.E. Claude Marketplace
*We are Not Of Planet Earth*

Claude Code plugins by [Studio N.O.P.E.](https://github.com/N-O-P-E).

## Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **gcp-setup** | Automates Google Cloud Console setup via browser. Walks through project creation, API enabling, service accounts, IAM, billing, OAuth, Cloud Run, and firewall config. |

## Install

Add the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add n-o-p-e/claude-marketplace
```

Install a plugin:

```
/plugin install gcp-setup@nope-marketplace
```

## Requirements

The `gcp-setup` plugin requires:
- Chrome DevTools MCP plugin installed and connected
- Chrome browser running
- A Google account with access to GCP

## How gcp-setup works

1. **Discovery** — Gathers all requirements before touching the browser. If invoked mid-feature, it auto-detects GCP needs from your codebase (package dependencies, config files, env vars).
2. **Planning** — Presents a numbered plan of every step, flagging which ones require manual action (auth, billing confirmation).
3. **Execution** — Opens Chrome and walks through GCP Console step by step, taking screenshots to verify each action.
4. **Manual handoffs** — Pauses for Google sign-in, billing confirmation, 2FA, and terms acceptance.
