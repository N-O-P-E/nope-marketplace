# Google Search Console Audit — Browser-Automated

Opens Google Search Console in the browser and reads every report that matters for SEO health. Returns a prioritised, actionable fix list.

---

## Before You Start

1. Call `list_pages` to verify Chrome DevTools MCP is connected.
2. If it fails: "Please open Chrome and make sure the DevTools MCP extension is active."
3. Confirm the domain to audit. If not already known, ask:
   - "What domain should I audit? (e.g. https://example.com/)"
4. The user must already be signed in to Google Search Console in Chrome. If not, tell them to sign in first — you cannot handle Google authentication.

---

## The Audit Workflow

```
┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
│   Overview  │ → │  Indexing   │ → │  Sitemaps   │ → │  Shopping & │
│   (snapshot)│   │  (drill in) │   │  (status)   │   │  Structured │
└─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘
                                                               │
                                                    ┌─────────────────┐
                                                    │  Produce Report │
                                                    └─────────────────┘
```

Work through each section below. Always `take_snapshot` after navigating — GSC is a React app that loads asynchronously.

---

## Step 1: Overview

Navigate to:
```
https://search.google.com/search-console?resource_id=DOMAIN
```
(Replace `DOMAIN` with the URL-encoded property, e.g. `https%3A%2F%2Fperfectpillows.nl%2F`)

`wait_for` text like the site name or "Overzicht" / "Overview", then `take_snapshot`.

**Capture from the overview:**
- Total indexed pages
- Total non-indexed pages
- Core Web Vitals summary (good / needs improvement / poor, mobile + desktop)
- Shopping section: product snippets valid/invalid, merchant listings valid/invalid
- Any "Recommendations" / "Aanbevelingen" cards — these flag recent anomalies
- HTTPS status

`take_screenshot` for the visual record.

---

## Step 2: Page Indexing Report

Navigate to:
```
https://search.google.com/search-console/index?resource_id=DOMAIN
```

`wait_for` "Niet geïndexeerd" / "Not indexed", then `take_snapshot`.

**Capture the full reasons table.** It typically shows up to 10 rows with:
- Reason (Dutch or English depending on account locale)
- Source (Website / Google systems)
- Validation status
- Page count

**Key reasons to watch for and their meaning:**

| Reason | What it means | Typical fix |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Alternative page with correct canonical tag | Pages correctly pointing to a canonical — but validation failed | Canonical tag misconfigured or the canonical URL itself has issues |
| Crawled – currently not indexed | Google crawled but chose not to index | Thin content, duplicate content, low quality signals |
| Google chose different canonical than user | Google is overriding your canonical tag | Canonical points to a URL Google doesn't trust as the main URL |
| Duplicate without user-selected canonical | Missing canonical tags on duplicate pages | Add canonical tags |
| Redirect page | Redirect URLs appearing as discovered pages | Remove redirects from sitemap; fix internal links pointing to old URLs |
| Not found (404) | Broken pages Google has discovered | Add 301 redirects or fix internal links |
| Excluded by noindex tag | Pages explicitly excluded | Verify noindex is intentional |
| Blocked by robots.txt | Crawl blocked | Verify robots.txt allows important pages |
| Found – currently not indexed | Discovered but not yet crawled/indexed | May resolve itself; check priority |
| Soft 404 | Page returns 200 but looks like an error | Fix the page or return proper 404 |

`take_screenshot` of the full table.

---

## Step 3: Sitemaps

Navigate to:
```
https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps?resource_id=DOMAIN
```

`wait_for` "sitemap" or "Sitemap", then `take_snapshot`.

**Capture:**
- Which sitemaps are submitted
- Status (Successful / Has errors)
- Last read date — if >30 days ago, GSC may not be seeing updates
- Discovered pages count per sitemap
- Compare discovered pages in sitemap vs total indexed pages — a big gap means the sitemap is incomplete

**Common sitemap issues for Shopify stores:**
- Only `sitemap.xml` submitted but not the sub-sitemaps (`sitemap_products_1.xml`, `sitemap_collections_1.xml`, `sitemap_pages_1.xml`, `sitemap_blogs_1.xml`)
- Sitemap contains redirected or 404 URLs
- Sitemap was never submitted (only auto-discovered)

`take_screenshot`.

---

## Step 4: Core Web Vitals (if issues flagged)

If the overview showed any "needs improvement" or "poor" pages, navigate to:
```
https://search.google.com/search-console/core-web-vitals?resource_id=DOMAIN
```

`wait_for` "Mobiel" / "Mobile", then `take_snapshot`.

**Capture:**
- Mobile: good / needs improvement / poor counts
- Desktop: good / needs improvement / poor counts
- Which metric is failing (LCP / CLS / INP) — click into the report if counts > 0

---

## Step 5: Shopping Reports (for e-commerce)

### Product Snippets
```
https://search.google.com/search-console/r/product?resource_id=DOMAIN
```

`wait_for` "Productfragmenten" / "Product snippets", `take_snapshot`.

Capture: valid count, invalid count, any error types listed.

**"Weergave van item verbeteren" / "Improve item display" warnings** are non-critical but worth fixing — items are valid but missing recommended fields. Common ones on Shopify:

| Missing field | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `priceValidUntil` (in `hasVariant.offers`) | No offer expiry date on product variants | Add to structured data snippet |
| `aggregateRating` | No review score on product | Wire to reviews app metafields |
| `review` | No individual reviews | Wire to reviews app |

**To see which URLs are affected:** click the warning row in the table — it drills into a list of exact URLs and item names. Always check this before assuming all products are affected (often just 2–5 pages).

**After fixing**, click "Oplossing valideren" / "Validate Fix" to trigger an immediate re-crawl of the affected URLs. GSC will report back within a few days.

### Merchant Listings
```
https://search.google.com/search-console/r/merchant-listings?resource_id=DOMAIN
```

`wait_for` "Verkopersvermeldingen" / "Merchant listings", `take_snapshot`.

Capture: valid count, invalid count, any missing fields (price, availability, image, etc.).

---

## Step 6: Security & Manual Actions

Click the "Beveiligingsproblemen en handmatige acties" / "Security & Manual Actions" section in the sidebar, or navigate to:
```
https://search.google.com/search-console/manual-actions?resource_id=DOMAIN
```

Check for any manual penalties. If any are present, they are the highest priority fix.

---

## Producing the Report

After completing all sections, output a structured report:

```markdown
## Search Console Audit: [domain] — [date]

### Summary
- Indexed: X pages
- Not indexed: Y pages (Z reasons)
- Core Web Vitals: X good / Y needs improvement / Z poor (mobile)
- Manual actions: none / [list]

### Issues by Priority

#### P0 — Fix immediately
[Any manual actions, security issues, or >50% drop in impressions]

#### P1 — High impact
[Large non-indexing buckets with fixable causes: 404s, redirects in sitemap, missing canonicals]

#### P2 — Medium impact
[Canonical misconfigurations, Google overriding canonicals, thin content]

#### P3 — Monitor
[Noindex pages to verify intentional, robots.txt blocks, small counts]

### Fixes

**[Issue name]** — X pages affected
- Root cause: ...
- Fix: ...
- How to verify: ...

### What's Healthy
[List things that are working well — don't just report problems]
```

## GSC Quirks to Know

- **UI is localised.** The account language affects all button and label text. Dutch accounts show "Niet geïndexeerd", "Pagina's", "Verzonden sitemaps" etc. Use the snapshot as-is — the a11y tree will show the localised strings.
- **Data lag.** GSC data is typically 2–3 days behind. Don't panic if a fix you made yesterday isn't reflected.
- **Indexing report only shows ~1000 URLs** in the drilldown. For large sites, use the Export button to get the full list.
- **Validation failures** on canonical/duplicate issues mean GSC ran a re-crawl after you asked it to validate and the issue was still present — not that validation is in progress.
- **"Crawled – currently not indexed"** is the hardest to fix. Google has no obligation to index every page. Common causes: thin product variant pages, faceted navigation URLs, low E-E-A-T signals, content too similar to already-indexed pages.
- **Sitemap discovered pages ≠ indexed pages.** The sitemap number is URLs Google found in the sitemap file. It doesn't mean those pages are indexed.

---

## Shopify-Specific Fixes

For Shopify stores, these are the most common issues and fixes:

**Canonical tag problems**
- Shopify automatically adds canonical tags pointing to the product's main URL
- Variant URLs (`?variant=123`) should canonicalise to the base product URL
- Collection-scoped product URLs (`/collections/xxx/products/yyy`) should canonicalise to `/products/yyy`
- Check the theme's `meta-tags.liquid` snippet — if a `{{ canonical_url }}` is not being output correctly, all pages are affected

**Incomplete sitemap**
- Shopify's `/sitemap.xml` is an index file linking to sub-sitemaps
- Submit `sitemap.xml` to GSC — it will auto-discover `sitemap_products_1.xml`, `sitemap_collections_1.xml`, etc.
- Shopify excludes pages with `noindex` from the sitemap automatically

**404 pages**
- Use the Shopify Admin → Online Store → Navigation → URL Redirects to add 301s
- Or add redirects programmatically via the Admin API

**Redirect pages in index**
- Any URL in the sitemap that now redirects needs to be removed or the sitemap regenerated
- Old collection/product URLs that were changed are common culprits

**Noindex on important pages**
- Shopify adds `noindex` to search results pages, account pages, cart, checkout — this is correct
- If collection or product pages are noindexed, check: theme settings → search engine indexing, and the page's SEO settings in Shopify Admin

## Fixing Product Snippet Warnings on Shopify (Structured Data)

When GSC flags missing fields like `priceValidUntil`, `aggregateRating`, or `review`, the fix is to replace Shopify's built-in `structured_data` filter with a custom snippet you control.

### How Shopify outputs product structured data by default

Shopify themes (e.g. Horizon) use the built-in Liquid filter in `sections/product-information.liquid`:
```liquid
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {{ closest.product | structured_data }}
</script>
```

This outputs a valid `ProductGroup` schema but omits recommended fields. You can't extend it — you have to replace it.

### The fix: one snippet in the `<head>` for all page types

Create `snippets/structured-data.liquid` and render it from `layout/theme.liquid`:

```liquid
{%- render 'meta-tags' -%}
{%- render 'structured-data' -%}   {%- comment -%} ← add this line {%- endcomment -%}
```

The snippet uses `if/elsif` on `request.page_type` to output the right schema per page:

```liquid
{%- if request.page_type == 'index' -%}
  {%- comment -%} WebSite + SearchAction {%- endcomment -%}
{%- elsif request.page_type == 'product' -%}
  {%- comment -%} ProductGroup with priceValidUntil + aggregateRating {%- endcomment -%}
{%- elsif request.page_type == 'collection' or request.page_type == 'list-collections' -%}
  {%- comment -%} ItemList {%- endcomment -%}
{%- elsif request.page_type == 'article' -%}
  {%- comment -%} BlogPosting {%- endcomment -%}
{%- elsif request.page_type == 'blog' -%}
  {%- comment -%} Blog {%- endcomment -%}
{%- elsif request.page_type == 'page' -%}
  {%- comment -%} WebPage / ContactPage / AboutPage {%- endcomment -%}
{%- endif -%}
```

Then remove `{{ closest.product | structured_data }}` from `sections/product-information.liquid` and `{{ article | structured_data }}` from `sections/main-blog-post.liquid`.

### Adding `priceValidUntil`

In the product branch, generate a date 1 year out:

```liquid
{%- assign price_valid_until = 'now' | date: '%Y' | plus: 1 | append: '-12-31' -%}
```

Add to each offer in the `hasVariant` loop:
```liquid
"priceValidUntil": {{ price_valid_until | json }},
```

Price formatting without currency symbol quirks:
```liquid
"price": "{{ variant.price | divided_by: 100 }}.{{ variant.price | modulo: 100 | prepend: '00' | slice: -2, 2 }}"
```

### Adding `aggregateRating` (requires reviews app)

`aggregateRating` only makes sense when there are real reviews. Wire it conditionally to two sources:

```liquid
{%- liquid
  assign rating_value = nil
  assign rating_count = 0

  # Source 1: standard Shopify reviews namespace (Judge.me, Loox, Okendo when sync enabled)
  if product.metafields.reviews.rating != blank
    assign rating_value = product.metafields.reviews.rating.value.rating
    assign rating_count = product.metafields.reviews.rating_count.value | default: 0

  # Source 2: Judge.me native metafield (type: json, always written when Judge.me is installed)
  elsif product.metafields.judgeme.review_widget_data != blank
    assign jdgm = product.metafields.judgeme.review_widget_data.value
    assign rating_count = jdgm.number_of_reviews | default: 0
    if rating_count > 0
      assign rating_value = jdgm.average_rating | times: 1.0
    endif
  endif
-%}

{%- if rating_value != nil and rating_count > 0 -%}
,"aggregateRating": {
  "@type": "AggregateRating",
  "ratingValue": {{ rating_value }},
  "reviewCount": {{ rating_count }}
}
{%- endif -%}
```

**Judge.me note:** Judge.me writes to `judgeme.review_widget_data` (type: `json`) automatically. To also write to the standard `reviews` namespace, enable it in Judge.me → Settings → Integrations → Shopify Product Ratings.

### Important: Shopify section scope vs layout scope

Variables assigned in `layout/theme.liquid` are **NOT accessible in sections** rendered via `{{ content_for_layout }}`. Sections run in an isolated scope. This means you cannot use a Liquid flag set in `theme.liquid` to suppress built-in structured data in a section. The only reliable fix is to **remove** the built-in filter calls from the sections entirely.

### On Horizon theme updates

`layout/theme.liquid` and `snippets/structured-data.liquid` are not Horizon-owned files — theme updates never touch them. The only post-update task is removing the built-in `structured_data` calls from the two updated sections if Horizon adds them back. Two lines, two deletes.

### Verifying the fix

Check that each page type outputs exactly one schema (no duplicates):

```python
import urllib.request, re, json

def check(url):
    html = urllib.request.urlopen(urllib.request.Request(url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})).read().decode()
    blocks = re.findall(r'<script[^>]*ld\+json[^>]*>(.*?)</script>', html, re.DOTALL)
    return [json.loads(b).get('@type') for b in blocks]
```

Expected output per page type:
- Homepage: `['WebSite', 'Organization']`
- Product: `['ProductGroup', 'Organization']`
- Collection: `['ItemList', 'Organization']`
- Article: `['BlogPosting', 'Organization']`
- Contact page: `['ContactPage', 'Organization']`

`Organization` is always present — injected by Shopify via `content_for_header`. Any duplicate `@type` values indicate a built-in filter is still active alongside the custom snippet.

## Important Principles

1. **Never log in.** If the user isn't already signed in to GSC, stop and ask them to sign in first. You cannot handle Google authentication.
2. **Read before concluding.** Take a snapshot of every report before making claims. GSC numbers change frequently.
3. **Prioritise by page count.** A 78-page canonical failure beats a 1-page robots.txt issue.
4. **Separate fixable from "monitor".** Some issues (crawled-not-indexed) are Google's choice. Be honest about what can and can't be forced.
5. **Screenshot each section.** Gives the user a visual record and lets you spot things the a11y snapshot misses.
6. **Check both mobile and desktop** for Core Web Vitals — they often differ.
